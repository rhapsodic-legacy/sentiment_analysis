##### Sentiment analysis models

+ The 'Previous Models' folder has older sentiment analysis models within. 
 
+ The 'sentiment analysis' folder has a lightweight model trained on Stanford's IMDB dataset, deployable via flask as a web app. Enter a line of text and have it classified in real time. To do this, enter 'python app.py' in terminal, and the web app will be available at "http://127.0.0.1:5000/". *Work in progress.*

+ The 'sentiment analysis v7' Jupyter Notebook file uses a Pytorch transformer based neural network to the make same sentiment analysis predictions on the Kaggle Twitter Airline Reviews dataset. *Work in progress.*
