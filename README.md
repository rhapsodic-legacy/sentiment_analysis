##### Sentiment analysis models

+ The 'Previous Models' folder has older sentiment analysis models within. 

+ The 'sentiment analysis v6' Jupyter Notebook file uses a Pytorch & BERT model to act as the benchmark for the 'v7' model to beat. This model is far better performing, currently. 

+ The 'sentiment analysis v7' Jupyter Notebook file uses a Pytorch transformer based neural network to the make same sentiment analysis predictions on the Kaggle Twitter Airline Reviews dataset. *Work in progress.*
